Certainly! Hereâ€™s a structured documentation for a hypothetical Go package named `server`. We will create an overview, describe its functionality, and detail any functions, types, and methods it includes. Please adapt the details as necessary based on the actual implementation of your `server` package.

# Server Package Documentation

## Overview

The `server` package provides functionalities to create, manage, and operate an HTTP server. It abstracts common operations needed to set up a web server, handle incoming requests, route them to appropriate handlers, and respond accordingly. The package is designed for ease of use, scalability, and performance.

## Installation

To use the `server` package, ensure you have Go installed on your machine. You can include this package in your Go application by importing it:

```go
import "path/to/your/server"
```

## Features

- Create and start an HTTP server.
- Register request handlers with configurable routes.
- Support for middlewares to handle cross-cutting concerns such as logging, authentication, and more.
- Graceful shutdown capabilities for clean server termination.

## Types

### Server

```go
type Server struct {
    Address string
    Port    int
    Router  *Router
}
```

#### Server Fields

- **Address**: A string representing the IP address where the server will listen for requests.
- **Port**: An integer representing the port number on which the server will listen.
- **Router**: A pointer to a `Router` object that defines the routing logic for incoming requests.

### Router

```go
type Router struct {
    routes map[string]http.HandlerFunc
}
```

#### Router Fields

- **routes**: A map linking HTTP methods and paths to handler functions.

## Functions

### NewServer

```go
func NewServer(address string, port int) *Server
```

#### Description

Creates a new instance of a `Server` configured with the provided address and port.

#### Parameters

- **address**: The IP address that the server should bind to.
- **port**: The port number for incoming requests.

#### Returns

- A pointer to the newly created `Server` instance.

### Start

```go
func (s *Server) Start() error
```

#### Description

Starts the HTTP server and listens for incoming requests on the specified address and port.

#### Returns

- An error if the server fails to start, otherwise, it returns `nil`.

### Stop

```go
func (s *Server) Stop() error
```

#### Description

Gracefully stops the HTTP server, allowing ongoing requests to finish before shutting down.

#### Returns

- An error if the server fails to stop, otherwise, it returns `nil`.

### RegisterRoute

```go
func (r *Router) RegisterRoute(method string, path string, handler http.HandlerFunc)
```

#### Description

Registers a new route with the specified HTTP method and path, linking it to the provided handler function.

#### Parameters

- **method**: The HTTP method (e.g., "GET", "POST").
- **path**: The URL path for the route.
- **handler**: The function to be called when the route is matched.

## Example Usage

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "path/to/your/server"
    "net/http"
)

func main() {
    srv := server.NewServer("localhost", 8080)
    
    srv.Router.RegisterRoute("GET", "/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        fmt.Fprintln(w, "Welcome to the server!")
    })

    if err := srv.Start(); err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error starting server:", err)
    }

    defer srv.Stop()
}
```

## Conclusion

The `server` package provides a straightforward way to build and manage an HTTP server in Go. With its ease of use and extensibility, developers can focus on building their application logic rather than on server management tasks.
